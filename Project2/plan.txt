We want to test the performance of diffrent programing languages such as c++, c# and python, by creating 2 to 3 different
sorting algorithms such as mergesort, quicksort and maybe multithreadid mergesort if we have the time.
We intend to run each language sorting algorithm with 2,4,8,16,32 and 64 milions elements to sort.
To mesure performance we currently intend to measure time, cache misses and dTLB
