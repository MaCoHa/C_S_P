#Testing variables
hashbits :
    partitions
number of threads


Test run
threads [1,2,4,8,16,32]

hashbits[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]


for i in hashbits:
    for j in threads:

#Testing measurements
    measure time in seconds and devide by the number of tuples
    such that we get number of tuples pr second
